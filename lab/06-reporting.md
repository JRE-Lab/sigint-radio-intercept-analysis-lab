+# Lab 06 — Intelligence Reporting
+
+## Objective
+Deliver a concise report that explains what you found and why it matters.
+
+## Report Template (1 Page)
+1. **Executive Summary** (3–5 bullets)
+2. **Collection Methodology** (equipment, bands, duration)
+3. **Key Findings** (patterns, notable intercepts)
+4. **Confidence & Limitations** (noise, antenna constraints, coverage gaps)
+5. **Legal/Ethical Compliance** statement
+
+Use the template in `templates/report_template.md` to speed up report creation.
+
+## Example Executive Summary
+- Airband activity peaked between 1200–1400 local time with 7 ATIS/ground intercepts.
+- NOAA weather loop was consistently readable, validating antenna placement.
+- AIS traffic suggests steady maritime flow in the harbor between 1600–1800.
+
+## Exit Criteria
+A completed report that references your intercept log and at least one decoded capture.
