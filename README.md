# SIGINT Radio Intercept Analysis Lab

This repository contains materials for a signals intelligence (SIGINT) radio intercept analysis lab. The lab guides you through legally capturing and analysing unencrypted radio signals with a software-defined radio (SDR). It emphasises SIGINT tradecraft – intercepting and classifying electronic signals to understand activity and intent.

## Overview

You will:

- Set up and calibrate an RTL-SDR or similar receiver on a PC.
- Tune across multiple bands (FM broadcast, weather radio, airband, ADS-B, AIS, amateur radio, satellite beacons) and log the frequency, modulation, date/time and signal strength of each intercept.
- Classify signals as communications intelligence (COMINT) or electronic intelligence (ELINT) based on content and origin.
- Decode unencrypted digital protocols (ACARS, AIS) using open-source tools.
- Correlate intercepts with publicly available information to understand context and possible patterns.
- Document legal and ethical considerations for intercepting unencrypted signals.

All data collected in this lab should be from unencrypted, public transmissions. The lab demonstrates core SIGINT concepts such as signal interception, classification and analysis using affordable equipment.
